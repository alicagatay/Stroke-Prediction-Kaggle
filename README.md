# Stroke-Prediction-Kaggle

This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the implementation of three different machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a stroke in a patient. The dataset used for this project is the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle.
